The JWT client you have seen is fine for most web apps where security isn't critical. But when security is paramount (for example, if you are dealing with a user's financial information), you will probably want to make some tweaks to how the client operates. In this exercise you will be challenged to create a modified version of the client which is slightly less user-friendly, but adds some extra security.

Your modified client should:

Not persist tokens in local storage. Refreshing the app should require the user to provide their login credentials again.
Refresh the JWT tokens more regularly. The token expiry on the server-side should be set to 15 minutes, and every ten minutes the client should attempt to refresh the token.
Automatically log the user out after five minutes of inactivity.
Show a dialog box one minute before the user is automatically logged out, allowing them to click a button to indicate that the are still using the application.
